Apple is incredibly secretive about the interview process, so not only did they not tell me who I would be meeting with, they refused to even tell me what subject matter would be covered. Naturally, I prepared in line with what I had discussed with the hiring manager and given my understanding of the role. I was then blindsided by interview after interview of highly technical machine learning and software development practice interviews, none of which focused on the actual application areas that were at the core of the role (NLP and dataset management). It was almost as if I was suddenly interviewing for a different job. Needless to say, things didn't work out.\\r\\n\\r\\nOh and then Apple refused to reimburse any of my expenses related to the onsite visit.\",\n",
       " \"Initial phone screen from recruiter, phone interview with hiring manager, technical interview, onsite interview. They  were extremely slow at every step. I had to follow up several times between each step just to make sure they were still considering me. It's been a few months since I did the onsite interview and I still haven't heard a definite yes or no even after following up with every person on the recruiting team.\",\n",
       " 'The interview process was very lengthy. I talked to 9 different people on the phone, presented a case study onsite and had 2 hours of lunch/interview on site. At the end, I did not hear from them for almost two weeks. I sent an email to follow up and after 3 days, the recruiter sent me \"no thank you\" email with no feedback. I asked for greater feedback as I had gone through almost 10 hours of interview with them. I never heard back. It is very disappointing to see the hiring process is a \"one-way\" road for Apple: when they need you, they keep calling you. When they don\\'t, they disappear. Very unprofessional.',\n",
       " 'Internal Apple recruiter reached out to me on LinkedIn, and set up a a phone call between me and one of the team members. It was a technical phone screening. Then I moved on to the next phone screen with the team lead, which was another technical phone screen. Then another call with the recruiter to set up the onsite interview. The onsite interview consisted of a 40 minutes presentation which I prepared a lot for. I had 8 rounds of interviews in one day with 8 people form the team and other teams. Some interviews were technical and some behavioral. I was there onsite from 10AM with back-to-back interviews. The recruiting coordinator \"forgot\" to schedule a time for lunch. So I had to go through the day without eating until 5PM. Rooms were not reserved for some interviews and we had walk around to find an available room. It was a total mess. After 8 rounds of interviews and 40 minutes of presentation I was done. \\r\\n\\r\\nAfter more than 1 month that I did not hear from them, I sent an email to them asking for some feedback. they said we are working on it and will get back to you. I again did not hear form them for another two weeks. So I sent another email again asking for feedback. Then the recruiter called me and said all the reviews were great, and all the candidates were good, it was a hard decision and we had to move forward with the candidate who go the highest score. \\r\\n\\r\\nThat\\'s fine if you do not want to move forward with an applicant. But not giving them any feedback for more than one month, and blaming it on \"we are very busy, and have too much on our plates\" is not an acceptable excuse. Candidates spent days preparing for such interviews and it is very disrespectful not to even care to email them back with the decision. I am sure had I not emailed them, I would not have heard back for another month. very disrespectful!',\n",
       " '16 people interviewed me in two days!! That was crazy! A variety of questions were asked, from teasers, programming questions to statistical questions. I liked how smart interviewers were.',\n",
       " 'Started with 2-3 phone screens after being contacted initially by a recruiter internal to Apple.  They then brought me on-site to the Cupertino, CA campus to meet 5 interviewers, which varied from programmers, data scientists, to managers and directors. The interview on-ste consisted of general knowledge questions regarding programming and statistics/math. There was an example of how to model certain data sets.']"
