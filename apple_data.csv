For the case study, we were given a dataset, a a problem statement and a week to put together insights/a presentation centered around A/B testing.

The final round was most challenging, involving multiple behavioral interviews, a product sense interview and a philosophical debate on Bayesian vs. frequentist statistics after reading an article that the interviewer wrote. My experience during the final rounds was very negative. One interviewer had a poor connection which led to a very awkward conversation where we couldn't understand each other. Another interviewer was constantly distracted and left 15 minutes early. And finally, the debate was extremely combative and the interviewer came off as a know it all.

I'm not a brilliant coder but I was able to talk through my solutions and their shortcomings so I got invited to a full day on-site.

That's where things went sideways. Apple is incredibly secretive about the interview process, so not only did they not tell me who I would be meeting with, they refused to even tell me what subject matter would be covered. Naturally, I prepared in line with what I had discussed with the hiring manager and given my understanding of the role. I was then blindsided by interview after interview of highly technical machine learning and software development practice interviews, none of which focused on the actual application areas that were at the core of the role (NLP and dataset management).

Then the recruiter called me and said all the reviews were great, and all the candidates were good, it was a hard decision and we had to move forward with the candidate who go the highest score.
