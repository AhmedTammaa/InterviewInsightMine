        "details": "Applied online, had a technical phone interview with the person who would be my manager. Typical help desk questions such as hardware and software troubleshooting steps, not super technical but a good gauge into seeing what you know. Went on to headquarters in New York, met with three people an hour each. These interviews get very technical, but also give a good overview of the role and company as a\u2026\u00a0 whole. Then there is a nice lunch where the person from the initial phone interview takes you out. After lunch, I had two more interviews with executives. It is a long and arduous process, but a very good learning experience and really shows you the quality of the firm and the intellect of the people they hire.So why was my overall experience neutral? After all the interviews, the person from HR comes in and starts with \"I spoke with the team and your reviews have generally been positive. It seems that you've got the job.\" So we go through the details of the position like salary, relocation, and such. I left the day feeling pretty confident I would be given an offer. The next week, my references were checked and then there would be a hiring meeting, but the manager was on vacation so it was scheduled for the week after. Three weeks after my final interview, the hiring meeting occurred and I was told I did not get the job. To be clear, this was not a negative experience because I didn't get the job. I get it, there were some questions I could\u2019ve answered better or things I could\u2019ve had more experience in. My issue was being told that I \"got the job\" when it was not guaranteed. I\u2019m not sure what happened in the three weeks between the interview and the meeting, and I don\u2019t think I will ever find out, but it left me with a negative experience of the whole situation.Don\u2019t let this experience discourage you from applying to DE Shaw, as the employees are some of the smartest people you will get to work with. I don\u2019t expect this to happen to many other people, but my advice to DE Shaw is to review what HR can and cannot say after the interview.",

Then he asked a simple coding + algorithmic question: implementing a merge iterator in C++. When I finished the coding, he asked a few question about the complexity of the algorithm, how to improve it (using priority queue). Got invitation for the on-site interview in\u2026\u00a0 that evening. Before going, i need to submit a sample code (you can choose any code you wrote, ~300 lines) for them to review.Went to NY for the second round (the hotel and restaurant was really nice). Got 3 technical interviews in the morning which went quite well. Then they decide to schedule another technical interview with a senior VP in the afternoon. He also asked me a few technical questions which are very interesting. E.g,- given a method foo(int a[4]). Write code to call foo with a = [0,0,0,0], [0,0,0,1],[0,0,0,2],[0,0,1,0],....,[2,2,2,2].- Given 2 classes of shapes (Rectangle, Circle) that inherits Shape and 2 classes of printers (BW, Color), that inherits Printer. Also given 4 methods:\u00a0\u00a0--- PrintRecBW(Rectangle s,BW p)\u00a0\u00a0--- PrintRecCol(Rectangle s,Col p)\u00a0\u00a0--- PrintCirBW(Circle s,BW p)\u00a0\u00a0--- PrintCirCol(Circle s,Col p)write a method to Print(Shape s, Printer p) to print out (s,p) using 4 methods above WITHOUT using \"if\". You are allowed to implement addition methods in given classes.I also did pretty well in this one. Finally, they schedule an interview with the manager of the team. He asked me a few general questions about my research and my working experience. Then he asked a few technical question which were very obscure, there are no right or wrong answers, e.g\u00a0\u00a0--- Do we need class Integer in Java?
