Some questions were about projects on my resume. These questions can sometimes go really deep into implementation details and reasons behind design decisions. The majority of questions emphasized on the theories and concepts from the CS undergrad core curriculum: data structure, algorithms, OS, networking, compilers, and software engineering. The fourth and last step is on-site. In the morning there were three technical interviews, each taking about fifty minutes. An engineer came in with me resume, from which he or she found some starter questions. After the resume questions, the interviewer started to ask coding questions. Depending on the interviewer, the questions, and how much time was left, the questions could be whiteboard coding only, or whiteboard coding plus peer-to-peer real coding on a computer. After three technical sessions, two engineers took me to lunch, which was explicitly stated to be not a part of the evaluation. I got to chat with them and ask a lot of questions. After returning from lunch, I met with a manager, who introduced his team and task to me. It was only about 20 minutes, since he was on a rush for a meeting. Then I met the HR whom I have been contacting throughout the recruiting process. The HR asked me some last questions, but nothing technical or behavioral.",

Online Coding Test: Have to solve a couple of questions in 2 hrs. There is enough time to complete the 2 questions if you know what you are doing.3. Phone Interview: Followed with a technical interview, easy as they are all about basic\u2026\u00a0 OS, data structures, sorting algos etc. Easy to get past this as well.4. Onsite Technical Interview: 3 Rounds.The process ended with HR showing you out after lunch. I am not sure if this is a positive or negative experience as the interview process have high standards, didn't expect any less but also too stringent and short sighted. My first 2 tech rounds onsite went very well but went a little over time meaning I was left with ~40 mins for the last interview. Every interviewer has a mind set that you have to solve 2-3 questions correctly and this became a problem when I was left with only 10-12 mins for the second question in my third interview. He was literally counting down and I felt like I as put on a clock to solve the problem within the time frame or would be kicked out. That is exactly what happened as I could only give him the algorithm with few hints but not code it. I also felt sick when the third interviewer looked down on me saying \"Oh I know, zeros and ones it's very complex!\" with a smirk on his face - Arrogant.Expecting a candidate to give an algorithm and code it bug free in around 20 mins for each question is random as the difficulty of the questions vary(also if you are coding in C++). This might not get you good candidates even if they are unless the firm is against C++ as I know they only focus on JVM languages. This is evident by the fact that almost everyone I met is in a team which has more than 2 openings for over 6 months.I know they are a great firm doing very well and was disappointed to not get the offer but felt like I could not have done anything much better except for may be managing my time better and I felt it should not get down to that.

Nothing very original, probably all questions he asked were among top 50 interview questions. He was a nice guy. Then they invite me to onsite in Houston.First\u2026\u00a0 interview was with a manager. General questions about my background. He asked some factual questions. Some of them were really stupid. I tried to answer all questions and I think my interpretations were good. I sometimes express that what he asks is not very meaningful because of xyz reason, he accepted etc.. Then he asked a coding question which was not hard. I solved it in less than 7-8 minutes I guess. You write code on a laptop. He look at the code and find a test case which fails the program. I suggest two ways to fix it and I fix it. Then he starts discussing which was is more efficient. I said express my idea. It was related with letters. I wrote the code in Java. He asked me, how can I efficiently convert uppercase letter to a lowercase letter. I answered using Java way of thinking. This guy was very interested in to the low level programming. He talks about a tricky way to do it. Actually before he mentioned, I gave an answer which was very similar to his answer. He did not like it for some reason. Then we talk about test cases. I gave two different answers. I tried to point out that I would test boundary conditions as well as regular conditions. I suggested an automated way to test the program that I wrote. He liked the idea. Then he tried to confuse me with an another idea which was actually identical. He said that details are very important for the company etc.. He even go into machine code level details of the implementation. It was a weird interview. I don't really like the guy. He was obsessed with stupid tricks. Even though, your answers are close to the tricks that he amazed with, he does not like to recognize that you know what he has in his mind. Weird guy, a type of guy which is impossible to make him happy.Then another guy came, he asked some questions about my background previous work etc.. He seems like he was very interested in to what I did before. I recently finished my PhD, I talk about what I did for my dissertation etc.. He asked me to write a binary tree. I wrote it. Then he wanted me to test it by printing it. I wrote a method which had a slight problem, but I solved (he also give an idea while solving it). I tested the tree. Everything was working etc..Two guys take me to lunch to a nice place. They told me that they won't give any feedback and I can ask any question that I want. I ask questions about the company and Houston. They seem like they were happy to work in Two Sigma and live in Houston. They tried to create an impression that very special people work in the company. They were nice guys.We returned to the company. The secretary came and said that they did not feel that I am a good match. Then I left from the company. It was a bit surprising because I wrote the code for two programming questions without any problem. Second interviewer behaved so nice. I answered most of first interviewers questions, I discussed a little bit and persist correctness of my answers. Maybe he did not like me because I was not submissive lol :) .",

They ask you to describe your experience and skills, then ask technical questions that may include coding and then you can ask them questions about their\u2026\u00a0 job and the company. Coding is done on a computer that they make available for the purpose of the interview, which is pretty neat because I can type faster than write on a white board and I could actually compile my code and test it. There was a lunch interview during which we talked about various technologies that the company is using.Overall I had a positive experience. The thing that made it negative is that during the interview process they made me think they are looking for a system-level developer, but at the end the last guy asked me if I'll be willing to throw away my system-level experience and do everything in Java. I said no, and they told me they are not looking for a person matching my skill set.",

I am like \"Who is this ? \" . He explained me that once upon a time I interviewed with 2 sigma. The recruiter forced me many times to continue the process. I was so pissed off but he was a nice guy and he wasn't ready to keep the phone till I commit to come in the morning.I thought there is no harm in giving the interview. I went to interview about couple of hours late hoping that they would just not take me in. They still did. 2 short interviews and then recruiter comes and tells me I am not a good fit for remaining round. Who does that ? Can't they just email me later. They think they are saving our time but it's just rude. On top of that he mentioned that I am lucky to come here that only 2% of candidates reach here. I was thinking what kind of candidates you guys interview ? Are they software engineers or you interview random people on street ?I don't remember the interview questions but all the interview process were extremely simple.

It's really a disjoint sets\u2026\u00a0 problem. 2. You are given a list of strings. Removing a letter from any string yields a different string that may or may not exist in the list as an independent entity. This is one link of a \"string chain\". Find the longest chain in the array. Solved with a hashtable.Interview day: 1. Code a function that matches regular expressions with targets. There is a DP and a recursive solution. 2. Test it extensively in a main. Write a function to autogenerate test cases. 3. Code a postfix notation calculator. Doable with a stack. Now, what if you wanted to support arbitrary operations on some variable number of preceding numbers? How does the code change? 4. You are given a tree in the form of a list of (value, parentndx, intree) tuples, where intree is a boolean denoting whether the node is in the tree, and parentndx is the location in the list of the parent node of this node. The root's parent is -1. Write a function remove(ndx) that removes the node at that ndx and all its children in O(n). It requires caching which nodes have been visited and a recursive function that checks whether a node in the list should be removed (terminates on parentndx==-1 || ndx or when it finds a cached node that was already removed and visited). 5. You are given two infinite streams of data, where each datum has fields (timestamp, value). The streams have a single function take() that pops the oldest thing off and returns it or \"blocks\" until something arrives in the queue for it to return. Data might arrive much later than its timestamp. You are given a function output(a,b), which takes two values, one from each stream, and computes something. You want to call output() on all (a,b) pairs that have timestamps less than some given interval apart, and you want to do this as soon as any data that completes such a pair arrives. Construct pseudocode that will do this. The answer involves two threads that each manage a list of numbers pulled off their stream, pull a number from the other thread's list, try to match it against everything, and then carefully discard data when appropriate. 6. You are managing a webservice and get a complaint about the page loading slowly. What is a possible cause of the problem? How would you check that? Okay, say that's not the problem.

I had an amazing time during all my interviews - there are some very smart, creative and collaborative people at this company. My recruiter was also amazing and I never had trouble reaching them. I went in not thinking I was likely to take an offer if\u2026\u00a0 given to me, and left just extremely impressed with the company and the people I met :).This whole process went wrong when that I was told I had an offer (that still needed to be officially approved) and then again told 20 days later that they actually under estimated how many people would accept their new grad offers and they would have to retract their offers that had not yet been processed into writing. During this 20 days I had declined an offer from a good company and not sent in any applications because I was really happy with my position (and had already gone over salary/benefits with my recruiter). My recruiter felt really bad about it - and they were great - so my guess is this is coming from higher up where someone who was disconnected from us lowly new grads didn't feel like it was bad for us entry-levels to take the hit from their (two sigma's) risky choices.If you want to work here, I'd still say go for it! I had a blast at my interviews and was so happy when the hiring committee approved me. This made the disappointment much worse than it would have been if it did not seem like a good place to work. On the other hand, if you do decide to apply and end up being told that you will get an offer make sure to continue to go full force in your applications until you have signed a document, because they won't hesitate to use their legal right to go back on their words.Just in case you were concerned, I am now hired at one of the tech giants and looking forward to the future :).",

I received a phone call the day after where the recruiter said that things were looking good and received the official offer about a week later.",

I heard nothing for weeks, then pinged them asking for an update. It turned out\u2026\u00a0 they had entirely forgotten, so I had to give them new availability and schedule again.

My first interviewer needed my help to set up the IDE with his development environment for his programming question, and then started texting during my interview. My second interview was a systems-design interview that was fine and well-run. My third and final interview was a question directly taken out of Cracking the Coding Interview which I had not seen before, and the interviewer barely spoke to me the whole time even as I was asking questions; she only spoke to me to ask me to move out of the way so she could grab a snack off the table I was working on. After they told me that the decision was no, I left for the airport to find out that the hotel they booked me at had charged my personal credit card for the room instead of the company's account, which took several days to resolve. I had been told that I would be sent a satisfaction survey after my interview, and I do recall receiving one after my previous onsite, but I did not receive one this time -- I assumed that was on purpose.",

        "details": "The very first step is to have a \"conversation\" with a TS internal recruiter. I saw conversation in quotation marks because, you will not be doing much talking. The recruiter will be reading from his script about TS at 100 miles per hour with all the charisma of a wet towel.Then I took a HackerRank test. If you have been prepping with Leetcode before hand, then you will likely find\u2026\u00a0 the problems easy, and you should be able to code it up in about 30 minutes, even though you have 3 hours available.The next step is a technical phone screen. The first attempt was a failure, because the interviewer forgot to call me. With the market so hot for SWEs, I would generally automatically reject the company. It's a sign that they either don't have their stuff together, or that recruiting isn't all that important to them. But I gave them a second chance, since TS is considered to be a well reputed company.On the second attempt, I was pleasantly surprised that the interviewer actually remembered to call. The technical screen is done on a HackerRank Pair Coding screen. The interviewer verbally explained the problem. Allowed me a few minutes to ask clarifying questions, and set a timer to 30 minutes when that was over. I solved 90% of the problem. While I was coding I was discovering some edge cases here or there, and I was quick to react and adjust my strategy. There was a bug in the code, but again, most of it was correct.Then the interviewer dug into run-time and asked me a bunch of technical trivia questions. These two parts of the interview were so awkward. It felt like I was being interrogated by the FBI or something. The interviewer barely engaged in conversation with me, which is so beyond weird.The last section is where I got to ask the interviewer questions. At this part I was at least able to confirm my initial suspicions that the company just doesn't have it stuff together. It's apparent that their team structure is an afterthought. Their technology sounded outdated. I could tell that the interviewer was pretty uncomfortable talking about the technology they use.I did not make it past the technical phone screen.

This was appreciated (I was just busy travelling for holidays)Step 3 -- Technical Phone\u2026\u00a0 Screen. Most rude and arrogant phone screen I've ever had. For context, I'm a mid-30s PhD student who has had 10 internships and worked at a world-renowned research lab for 3 years. My point is that I've had a LOT of technical phone interviews over the years, and this one was the worst.The problems were actually very interesting and I can't complain. Although, they were about probability, which I totally did not expect. Nobody had mentioned the nature of the call, so I assumed it would be like my Google, Uber, Amazon interviews and ask stuff about machine learning research or real-time coding. Anyway, the problems were fine. I did pretty poorly on them, and I was playful with my ignorance (I at least knew what type of direction to take), and I mentioned that if I knew this would concern probability, I would have studied. Basically, the guy was incredibly short with me and way more rude than how I talk w/ spam phone callers. We then continued to an open-ended machine learning question, which I felt I did a great job on. He gave me silence. When I asked if he had any feedback or wanted to continue w/ more details, he said, \"I mean, it's an open-ended question. [Whatever]\"At the end of the call, it was finally my turn to ask him questions about his job and Two Sigma. I asked what does he work on (since I had no clue what his job title is, his team, or anything about him). He merely responded with a 1-word answer that's merely the name of the field (i.e., machine learning). That's 1 step away from just saying \"Math\" Haha, so I could tell he had no interest in talking with me and rather hang up. I alluded to this by saying, \"well, I have more questions, but I feel I bombed the earlier probability questions, so maybe you don't want me to ask more questions?\" His reply \"It's your call.\"Me (still upbeat in tempo): What's your favorite thing about working at Two Sigma?Him: There are many smart people.(At this point, we said our thank yous and hung up).He reflects Two Sigma poorly.",

Second is a HackerRank coding test consisting of 2 problems, with 3h to solve them, which means you need to pass most if not all unit tests (which are not published). While most tests are testing correctness, there was at least one that tests performance and fails for a brute-force slow\u2026\u00a0 implementation. If the test went well, a technical phone interview follows. Mine consisted again of a brief intro to Two Sigma, followed by series of technical questions, followed by an opportunity for me to ask questions. Knowing/remembering CS basics is helpful, O(n) stuff, hashing, trees, design patterns, etc. After that you'll be invited for a day of in-person interviews, where the first half of the day consists of mostly technical interviews. I was sitting on a computer with the interviewer fixing a broken implementation and writing unit tests using Eclipse. In another interview, I designed a game on the whiteboard and later implemented it in Eclipse. You'll be taken out to lunch while the team discusses how well you did and whether they'll call you back for afternoon interviews. I was asked back and had 3 further interviews with managers in 3 areas for which I was a potential fit. Questions were a lot higher-level then. A 4th discussion is with HR to go over what comes next. I was called back after a few days by HR with the good news that they hoped to get me on board but wanted further information. I had yet another interview, followed by some preliminary comp discussions followed eventually by the offer package. To prepare for this and many other technical interviews, I found the book Cracking the Coding Interview very helpful, it goes over some basics you might've forgotten in the last n years of work, with good advice on prep, test taking, design, etc. A good understanding of unit tests will be useful, too.I've found the Two Sigma HR people to be helpful and responsive.

First of all, the interviewer clearly did not understand the position for which I was interviewing. She\u2026\u00a0 asked only the standard interview questions, none specific to the job, and when I asked my questions, she couldn't even answer basics like what skills they were looking for, who, or how it would be evaluated, etc... Second, she interrupted nearly every answer I gave. Instead of letting me finish, she would just interject a new question while I was still answering. Finally, when I inquired about skills they were looking for, her first answer was humility, a not so subtle hint that she felt my interview answers were boastful. Humility is a personality trait, not a skill. Also, this is such a double standard because as a woman when I talk about myself and my accomplishments it's bragging but when a man does it, it gets him the job? I knew when the call ended I would be rejected, but I was cordial in my email response to the rejection, even asking for feedback of which I received none. I have no problem being rejected for jobs for which it is clear I am not the best fit for the job, but when I am not even given the chance because of a crappy interviewer?

The head of investor relations told me more details about the company\u2026\u00a0 and my position, then asked basic questions about my experience, and then answered some of my questions about the company. He then asked me to complete a brief eight slide PowerPoint presentation on hedge funds and Two Sigma. He stated that it should not be an in depth research project, but they were looking to see how I presented information \"from the first page of Google results\". I submitted the presentation in less than a week. I followed up with a phone call a week later, then followed up again by email (submitting more information and updates from my current job experience) with both the head of investor relations and the recruiter. I heard back a week later; the head of investor relations informed me that they had appreciated my PowerPoint. The recruiter contacted me separately and stated politely that I was not a match, but that I should feel free to apply to other positions. As I am a recent graduate, other candidates most likely had more relevant work experience.",

Believe me, lunch - if you make it that far - is definitely part of the process. I was told that a lot of people don't make it to lunch or are told they are done immediately after coming back from the restaurant. All of the people I interviewed with were very nice, proud of the company, proud to work there, and eager to tell me why they thought I should want to work there too. The problem was that no one seemed to have a good understanding of exactly what job I was interviewing for. I knew what they needed and what the job would entail, but this was a newly created position and the people interviewing me really didn't have a clue. It was also very much outside the sphere of all the interviewers.They tried to interview me as though I was another programmer, and that just didn't work. That wasn't the position at all, but it was like talking to someone who only sees one color.The day was long and tiring, but I felt I had connected with most of the people I spoke with. I did not get an offer. I was told they decided to go with a \"data jockey\" - someone who could just load data into databases all day, which was not what they had told me they wanted.

A lot of chit chat in\u2026\u00a0 the conversation, trying to feel me out, see what kind of a fit I would be. Shortly after, I was told that I was going to move to the next step, the all day, in person interview. I took a day off from work and several deep breaths.It was intense but not unpleasant. I was shown to a small room off of the main reception area and that is where I stayed all day, except for lunch. On the hour, every hour from 9 AM to 4 PM different individuals came in to talk to me. The questions got repetitive and a group interview might have been preferable, to eliminate the duplication. Some of the people who met with me were more professional than others. I never knew the names or job titled of some of the interviewers. Each interview was pretty much like the last: a review of my background and work history and a description of how wonderful it was to work at TS.I must have done OK because I made it through lunch. I was told by the in-house recruiter that people who wash out leave at lunch. It was a long day, I didn't get out of there until 5 PM.I found out later that there was another candidate I was up against who was less experienced and eventually - it took a while - I was told that they went with the less experienced candidate. Interestingly, a few weeks later I received a call from the external recruiter asking if I was still interested in TS. I said I was, very much. He said TS asked him to get in touch with me and see if I was open to discussion.

Either they are reading off of something or the guy I talked to described it really well-learned much about the company. While there's time to in turn, ask the\u2026\u00a0 interviewer some questions, he didn't have much knowledge outside of his own team, and some basic logistics information.2. Second step was an online coding test on Hackerrank. ~3 hours long and I had to use it right down to the second. One of the question forced me to optimize my answer for certain test cases (I did so in a practical sense, instead of coming up with a new algorithm).3. A week later, technical phone interview. Asked about a handful of basic concept/knowledge questions and algorithm problems. Refer to other reviewers' questions here.4. 2 weeks later, another technical phone interview. Similar stuff, but obviously different questions.A week later, I was rejected :( Somewhat a slow and frustrating process if you don't ace the first technical phone interview.",

        "details": "It started after a recruiter reached out to me after I submitted my resume into the GHC (Grace Hopper Conference) resume bank. They invited a few of us in the Boston area to a nice dinner, during which two female engineers tried hard to sell the company to us. Then, there was a online assessment, questions are easily found online. After that I received notice very quickly that they'd like\u2026\u00a0 to schedule a 30-minute in-person interview with me at GHC, where I code on the computer alongside an engineer. That one was the hardest problem throughout the process regarding regular expression. I was only able to get a brute force solution with a lot of hints from the interviewer. Afterwards I was really certain I have failed so I didn't think much about it. Two weeks later I received notice that Two Sigma would like to schedule a phone interview with me. I was surprised, but went on with the interview anyways. I prepared extensively for this one, and it paid off. The interviewer asked standard questions that can easily found online. Then again, very quickly, I received notice that I moved on the final round - at this point, I am exhausted by their interview process, but I decided to go anyways because I get to go see their NYC office.It was a very last-minute trip, so I was pretty frazzled. They paid for airfare and hotel. Hotel was quirky. I went in to the interview the next day. On a whiteboard I saw 9 names. I knew they weren't going to hire 9 interns, so they knew that some of us would be sent home with no offers. I also remember multiple people say throughout the process, 'our internship is more competitive than our full-time job because there's less slots available, please try full-time if you don't get internship'. The first one went okay, I had to code in a new editor on a new computer, which slowed me down. It was also uncomfortable to have someone else look over my shoulders when I'm coding. I had a few bugs in the program, which my interviewer corrected. He seemed happy at the end. The second interview didn't go too well, I wasn't able to solve the problem. It was a tricky data manipulation problem, not at all related to algorithms. I think I could have done it if I were given more time and space to think. But maybe they were expecting people to be able to solve it under pressure in an hour. After that I was taken to lunch with two engineers, one of which tried hard to sell me the company, constantly comparing it to 'Google/Facebook', etc. I didn't have the hard to tell them that I already had an offer from Facebook at that point.When I returned from lunch, a recruiter I have never met before sat me down and told me that I was not selected. I was a bit sad, but grateful that they told me so quickly so I can get on my way. I ended up shopping some boutiques in the afternoon. Thankfully they gave me an umbrella as a swag, otherwise I would have drowned in the rain.I emailed the recruiter a week later about feedback and reimbursement. No response. I don't think I'm getting reimbursed.tl;dr: excessively long process (I had 4 screens for an internship, I only did 2 rounds at Facebook and got the offer within a week), overall nice recruiting process.",

The next time I scheduled it, it came on time and I finished it and turned it in on time. After that I have not heard back from the company or the recruiter. Prior to taking the test, the recruiter would call me often to persuade me to take the test even though I was not actively looking for a job. However, after the test, there was no sign of the recruiter or anyone from the company to inform me that I did not clear the test. Even an automated email would have sufficed.
